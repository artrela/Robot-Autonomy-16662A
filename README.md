## HW1: Controls & Kinematics

**Goals:** To explore force and impedance control on a scene in the MuJoCo (Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact)
simulator for the first part, and then implement forward and inverse kinematics for the Franka arm.

### Part 1: Controls 

- Explore impedence control and force control
- Extrapolate their differences in behavior (in static versus dynamic enviroments)

### Part 2: Kinematics

- Illicit the position of the end-effector by using the Jacobian and HTMs.
- Given a desired end position, use an Iterative IK method (Damped Least Squares) to determine the joint angles required to achieve that position.
